This project is designed to examine the development of alcohol use disorder and predict potential criminal activity. It was developed using R and Tidyverse for data manipulation, with models created using modelr. The project processes data from the 2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which uses key metrics on frequency of drug use, employment status and education, to answer our research question. The final Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) offers valuable insights into potential predictors of criminal behavior, accompanied by a step-by-step walkthrough of our methodology and visualizations.
